# cheap_eats

Welcome to Cheap Eats!

The issue:
College students have tons of bills to pay during college such as tuition, housing etc. This leaves little 
to no budget for other expenses such as food. Students shouldn't have to subject themselves to "struggle meals"
in order to survive. Hardworking students deserve to have good food that fits their budget. Many restaurants
like other companies, offer student discounts but it's hard to find which ones offer them. This is where
cheap Eats comes in!

Cheap Eats is an app where college students can come to find cheap local food restuarants in their area. 
This site offers different categories from most popular, cheapest, and nearest places. 

This site was created with Flask as the backend and Bootstrap as the front end. I worked on the bootstrap front-end and collaborated
with Jordan Torres on the Flask backend.

During this project I've learned how to access and implement API's and how to filter data to display on a site.
I've also gained more experience with working on a team and communicating and planning out how to approach the work.

Our biggest blockers were getting the data to display on the cards. The way we approached it was to go back and understand 
what was being sent back to us and how we need to format it to put it into our jinja syntax in our html files.

I'm super proud of this project because we implemented a site using dynamic data instead of static data, and it's deployed.

Here is where the site is deployed: {ENTER HEROKU SITE HERE}

I hope you enjoy this project!

This projected was done by me and Jordan Torres.
